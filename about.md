## About me
I've made this as a collection for some thoughts, projects, and ideas. I'm a Comp Sci Student at Florida International Univeristy. I'm fascinated by human perception and cognition so I spend a lot of time studying math, generative art, economics, neurology, and biology. Naturally led me to working with AI. An AI suggested that I add this sentence: "I'm also interested in the intersection of technology and technology." So yeah, I like technology too and especially how it changes us. I've worked a bit with post-quantum encryption too. [Here's my blog](https://alexb1200.github.io/blog) and [Here's my art](https://alexb1200.github.io/art) and [Here's my github](https://github.com/alexb1200).

### Here's a bit of my resume if you're interested.


*Dioptra Machine Learning Test Bench @ MITRE* 
{:.info}


 Dioptra is a NIST-sponsored test bench made to evaluate machine learning models for fairness and adversarial robustness. I architected, designed, and implemented in python a measurement module for Dioptra to enable researchers and practitioners alike to quickly test hypothesis and develop meaningful conclusions from data.

 *Machine Learning for Encryption @ FIU ADWISE* 
{:.info}

I initially worked as an assistant to a graduate student working on Multiparty Secure Computation. I then began a self-directed project on lattice-based cryptography using machine learning to increase the efficiency of sampling algorithms used to generate keys in-order to increase the feasibility of post-quantum encryption on IoT devices. Proof of concept developed in Mathematica and Implemented in python using TensorFlow 2.

Undergraduate Research on UAV Swarms @ FIU ACyD Lab
{:.info}

I developed a novel reinforcement learning algorithm to coordinate a swarm of UAVs on a search mission in a simulated environment. I then extended this work to deep reinforcement learning, implementing the algorithm in TensorFlow 2 and python. I was published in IEEE SmartComp as first co-author.
{:.success}

Undergraduate Research on Quantum Computing @ MDC
{:.info}

I implemented classical compression algorithms in python which I then compared to quantum compression algorithms I implemented using IBMâ€™s Qiskit platform. I presented a mathematical overview of quantum computing and its important algorithms in a poster board session to peers.
